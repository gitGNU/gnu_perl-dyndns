INSTALL: Perl dyndns - A Perl Dynamic DNS (DDNS) update client
--------------------------------------------------------------

Requirements

	Extra Perl CPAN modules need to be install before program
	can be used. See README.

	You can install additional modules from CPAN with command:

	    perl -MCPAN -e shell
	    cpan> install <module name>

System wide install

        Run makefile with appropriate parameters. The program is
        installed without any file extension (*.pl):

            make DESTDIR= prefix=/usr/local install

	To test the installation (to see how files are installed):

	    make install-test
	    find -type f tmp/

Manual install

        1. Copy bin/*.pl somewhere along $PATH
        2. Copy bin/*.1 somewhere along $MANPATH

        Study examples/*conf and write your own configuration file
        (optional; not required)

Usage

	The program contains --daemon mode, which makes program to
	sleep and wake periodically. This can be used e.g. under
	Windows.

	If cron(1) is available, it is recommended to use standard
	crontab(5) entry to periodically run the program. See
	manual page and section EXAMPLES.
