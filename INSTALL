Perl dyndns - A Perl Dynamic DNS (DDNS) update client
-----------------------------------------------------

Requirements

	Extra Perl CPAN modules need to be install before program
	can be used:

	    HTTP::Request::Common
	    HTTP::Headers
	    LWP::UserAgent
	    LWP::Simple
	    Sys::Syslog

	You can install these one by one with perl command:

	    perl -MCPAN -e shell
	    cpan> install <module name>

System wide install

        Run makefile with appropriate parameters. The program is
        installed without any file extension.

            make help
            make DESTDIR= prefix=/usr/local install

Manual install

        1. Copy bin/*.pl somewhere along $PATH
        2. Look at etc/template/*conf and apply ideas there and write your
           own configuration file (optional; not required)

End of file
