INSTALL: Perl dyndns - A Perl Dynamic DNS (DDNS) update client
--------------------------------------------------------------

Requirements

	Extra Perl CPAN modules need to be install before program
	can be used. See README.

	You can install additional modules from CPAN with command:

	    perl -MCPAN -e shell
	    cpan> install <module name>

System wide install

        Run makefile with appropriate parameters. The program is
        installed without any file extension (*.pl):

            perl Makefile.PL
            make DESTDIR= PREFIX=/usr/local ETCDIR=/etc/perl-dyndns install

	To test the installation (to see how files are installed):

	    make install-test
	    find -type f tmp/

Manual install

        1. Copy bin/*.pl somewhere along $PATH
        2. Copy bin/*.1 somewhere along $MANPATH

        Study examples/*conf and write your own configuration file
        (optional; not required)

Usage

	The program contain --daemon mode, which makes program to
	sleep and wake periodically. This can be used e.g. under
	Windows.

	However, if cron(1) is available, it is recommended to use
	standard crontab(5) entry to periodically run the program,
	say every 1h. This will conserve memeory and CPU resources.
	A system wide crontab entry example for Linux:

	   # /etc/cron.d/perl-dyndns
	   0 0-23 * * * perl /usr/local/bin/perl-dyndns <options>
